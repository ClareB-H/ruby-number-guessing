# Update this script to:
#
# - Ask for the player's name
# - Greet the player by name and explain the game
# - Ask for the maximum number to select as the secret number
# - Pick a secret number at random between 1 and the number entered
# - Ask the player (by name) to guess a number
# - Tell the player if they guessed correctly
# - If they guessed the number correctly, congratulate them for winning
#   and then tell them how many guesses it took for them to win.
# - If they did not guess correctly, tell them whether their guess was
#   too high or too low.
#
# DON'T FORGET:
#   Use methods to break down the problem and make the code easier to read.
